- 👋 Hi, I’m Karol (he/him; 🗣 _/kah-rol/_)
  - I live in Ottawa. I enjoy spending my free time outdoors: usually cycling, hiking, or ski touring.
- 👀 I’m a software developer with a decade of experience in mobile apps.
  - I've built native iOS and cross-platform react-native apps. I've worked a lot with Objective-C, Swift, and JavaScript (Flow & TypeScript). I live and breathe mobile UX.
- 🌱 I’m currently growing my full stack development skill-set.
  - I find building an API (GraphQL or REST) and a UI that consumes it to be pretty satisfying. I'd love to learn more about PostgreSQL and NoSQL.
- 💞️ I care about creating a more equal society where people come before profits. Technology should get out of our way and let us live more fulfilling lives.
